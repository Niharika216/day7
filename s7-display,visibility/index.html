    <h1>Top 7 Martial Arts</h1>
    <p>
      Martial art is associated with the arts of fighting in East Asia, and it
      is originally referred to as the combat system of Europe in the 1500s. The
      term martial arts is derived from Latin, which means Arts of Mars (the
      Roman God of War). It is a traditional and codified system of combat
      practiced for many reasons like military, law enforcement, self-defense,
      competition, mental, physical, entertainment, spiritual development, and
      preservation of the intangible cultural heritage of the nation. This form
      of fighting art is the most renowned and popular art as well as sports in
      the world. It has slowly become a worldwide phenomenon with mixed martial
      arts and demonstrations. Some people who seek to learn the best martial
      art and want to master the techniques travel throughout the world. So here
      is the list of the Top 10 Martial Arts in the World:

      Karate (空手) ( Japanese pronunciation: [kaɾate] ⓘ; Okinawan
      pronunciation: [kaɽati]), also karate-do (空手道, Karate-dō), is a martial
      art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous
      Ryukyuan martial arts (called te (手), "hand"; tī in Okinawan) under the
      influence of Chinese martial arts.While modern karate is primarily a
      striking art that uses punches and kicks, traditional karate also employs
      throwing and joint locking techniques.A karate practitioner is called a
      karate-ka (空手家).The Ryukyu Kingdom had been conquered by the Japanese
      Satsuma Domain and had become its vassal state since 1609, but was
      formally annexed to the Empire of Japan in 1879 as Okinawa Prefecture. The
      Ryukyuan samurai (Okinawan: samurē) who had been the bearers of karate
      lost their privileged position, and with it, karate was in danger of
      losing transmission. However, karate gradually regained popularity after
      1905, when it began to be taught in schools in Okinawa. During the Taishō
      era (1912-1926), karate was introduced to mainland Japan by Gichin
      Funakoshi and Motobu Chōki. Karate's popularity was initially sluggish
      with little exposition but when a magazine reported a story about Motobu
      defeating a foreign boxer in Kyoto, karate rapidly became well known
      throughout Japan.
      <br />
      In this era of escalating Japanese militarism,the name was changed from
      唐手 ("Chinese hand" or "Tang hand") to 空手 ("empty hand") - both of
      which are pronounced karate in Japanese - to indicate that the Japanese
      wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style.After World War II,
      Okinawa became (1945) an important United States military site and karate
      became popular among servicemen stationed there.The martial arts movies of
      the 1960s and 1970s served to greatly increase the popularity of martial
      arts around the world, and English-speakers began to use the word karate
      in a generic way to refer to all striking-based Asian martial arts.Karate
      schools (dōjōs) began appearing around the world, catering to those with
      casual interest as well as those seeking a deeper study of the art.
      Karate, like other Japanese martial arts, is considered to be not only
      about fighting techniques, but also about spiritual cultivation.Many
      karate schools and dōjōs have established rules called dōjō kun, which
      emphasize the perfection of character, the importance of effort, and
      respect for courtesy. Karate featured at the 2020 Summer Olympics after
      its inclusion at the Games was supported by the International Olympic
      Committee. Web Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign
      Affairs) claims that karate has 50 million practitioners worldwide,while
      the World Karate Federation claims there are 100 million practitioners
      around the world.

    <p id="brazilianDesc">
      Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro [ʒiw 'ʒitsu
      bɾazi'lejɾu, ʒu -]) is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based
      on grappling, ground fighting, and submission holds. BJJ focuses on taking
      one's opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using
      a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks,
      chokeholds, or compression locks. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was first developed
      in 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., and Hélio
      Gracie, after Carlos was taught a hybrid of traditional Japanese Jujitsu
      and Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917.
      Later on the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system Gracie
      Jiu-Jitsu.
      <br />
      BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the
      innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and judo, and
      became an essential martial art for modern MMA. BJJ revolves around the
      concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves
      against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight
      distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds
      and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for sport
      grappling and self-defense situations.Sparring, commonly referred to as
      "rolling" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role
      in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a
      method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of
      life.

      Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman,
      were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide
      evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.The earliest
      pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon
      basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The
      pottery was found near Santarém and provides evidence that the region
      supported a complex prehistoric culture.The Marajoara culture flourished
      on Marajó in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing
      sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound
      building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.Around the time
      of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an
      estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,mostly semi-nomadic,
      who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The
      population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the
      Tupis, Guaranis, Gês, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into
      the Tupiniquins and Tupinambás.Before the arrival of the Europeans, the
      boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars
      that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.These
      wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with
      cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war. While heredity had some weight,
      leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession
      ceremonies and conventions.Slavery among the indigenous groups had a
      different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a
      diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated
      into kinship relations.

    <h2 id="Taekwondo">3.Taekwondo</h2>
    <p id="taekwondoDesc">
      Taekwondo (/tɛkwən'doʊ/; Korean: 태권도; [t̪ʰɛ.k͈wʌ̹n.d̪o] ⓘ) is a Korean
      martial art and combat sport involving punching and kicking techniques.The
      word taekwondo can be translated as tae ("strike with foot"), kwon
      ("strike with hand"), and do ("the art or way"). In addition to its five
      tenets of courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control and indomitable
      spirit, the sport requires three physical skills: poomsae (품새), kyorugi
      (겨루) and gyeokpa (격파). Poomsae are patterns that demonstrate a range
      of kicking, punching and blocking techniques, kyorugi involves the kind of
      sparring seen in the Olympics, and gyeokpa is the art of breaking wooden
      boards. Taekwondo also sometimes involves the use of weapons such as
      swords and nun-chucks. Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform known as a
      dobok.
      <br />
      It is a combat sport which was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by
      Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate and
      Chinese martial arts.The oldest governing body for taekwondo is the Korea
      Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort
      by representatives from the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools,
      in Korea. The main international organisational bodies for taekwondo today
      are various branches of the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF),
      originally founded by Choi Hong-hi in 1966, and the partnership of the
      Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World Taekwondo Federation or
      WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo
      Association.Gyeorugi ([kjʌɾugi]), a type of full-contact sparring, has
      been an Olympic event since 2000. In 2018, the South Korean government
      officially designated taekwondo as Korea's national martial art.The
      governing body for taekwondo in the Olympics and Paralympics is World
      Taekwondo.
      <br />
      In 1959, the Korea Tang Soo Do Association (later Korea Taekwondo
      Association or KTA) was established to facilitate the unification of
      Korean martial arts. Choi wanted all the other member kwans of the KTA to
      adopt his own Chan Hon-style of taekwondo, as a unified style. This was,
      however, met with resistance as the other kwans instead wanted a unified
      style to be created based on inputs from all the kwans, to serve as a way
      to bring on the heritage and characteristics of all of the styles, not
      just the style of a single kwan.As a response to this, along with
      political disagreements about teaching taekwondo in North Korea and
      unifying the whole Korean Peninsula, Choi broke with the (South Korea) KTA
      in 1966, in order to establish the International Taekwon-Do Federation
      (ITF)— a separate governing body devoted to institutionalizing his Chan
      Hon-style of taekwondo in Canada.Initially, the South Korean president
      gave Choi's ITF limited support, due to their personal
      relationship.However, Choi and the government later split on the issue of
      whether to accept North Korean influence on the martial art. In 1972,
      South Korea withdrew its support for the ITF. The ITF continued to
      function as an independent federation, then headquartered in Toronto,
      Canada. Choi continued to develop the ITF-style, notably with the 1983
      publication of his Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do. After his retirement, the
      ITF split in 2001 and then again in 2002 to create three separate ITF
      federations, each of which continues to operate today under the same name.
      <br />
      In 1972, the KTA and the South Korean government's Ministry of Culture,
      Sports and Tourism established the Kukkiwon as the new national academy
      for taekwondo. Kukkiwon now serves many of the functions previously served
      by the KTA, in terms of defining a government-sponsored unified style of
      taekwondo. In 1973 the KTA and Kukkiwon supported the establishment of the
      World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), which later changed its name to "World
      Taekwondo" (WT) in 2017 due to the previous initialism overlapping with an
      internet slang term.While the Kukkiwon focus on the martial art and
      self-defence aspects of Kukki-Taekwondo, the WT promoted the sportive
      side, and its competitions employ a subset of the techniqes present in the
      Kukkiwon-style Taekwondo.For this reason, Kukkiwon-style Taekwondo is
      often referred to as WT-style Taekwondo, sport-style Taekwondo, or
      Olympic-style Taekwondo, though in reality the style is defined by the
      Kukkiwon, not the WT.[citation needed] Since 2021, taekwondo has been one
      of three Asian martial arts (the others being judo and karate), and one of
      six total (the others being the previously mentioned, Greco-Roman
      wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and boxing) included in the Olympic Games.
      It started as a demonstration event at the 1988 games in Seoul, a year
      after becoming a medal event at the Pan Am Games, and became an official
      medal event at the 2000 games in Sydney. In 2010, taekwondo was accepted
      as a Commonwealth Games sport.

    <p id="kungfuDesc">
      In general, kung fu or kungfu (/ˌpinyin: gōngfu pronounced [kʊ́ŋfu]) refers
      to the Chinese martial arts also called quanfa. In China, it refers to any
      study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to
      complete. In its original meaning, kung fu can refer to any discipline or
      skill achieved through hard work and practice, not necessarily martial
      arts (for example, the discipline of tea making is called the gongfu tea
      ceremony). The literal equivalent of "Chinese martial art" in Mandarin
      would be 中國武術 zhōngguó wǔshù. There are many forms of kung fu, such as
      Shaolin kung fu, Wing Chun, and tai chi, and they are practiced all over
      the world. Each form of kung fu has its own principles and techniques, but
      is best known for its trickery and quickness. It is only in the late
      twentieth century that this term was used in relation to Chinese martial
      arts by the Chinese community.The Oxford English Dictionary defines the
      term "kung-fu" as "a primarily unarmed Chinese martial art resembling
      karate" and attributes the first use of "kung fu" in print to Punch
      magazine in 1966.This illustrates how the meaning of this term has been
      changed in English. The origin of this change can be attributed to the
      misunderstanding or mistranslation of the term through movie subtitles or
      dubbing.
      <br />
      In the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for
      his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who
      portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black
      audiences and made him an important figure in this community.With the
      release of Enter the Dragon in 1973, kung fu movies became a hit in
      America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the
      films' popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth
      from every borough in New York City were attending movies in Manhattan's
      Times Square every night to watch the latest movies
      <br />
      Among these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during
      this time, hip hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers
      responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was
      DJ Kool Herc, who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic
      breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form
      of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing, a style of street dance
      consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance
      credit kung fu as one of its influences[citation needed]. Moves such as
      the crouching low leg sweep and "up rocking" (standing combat moves) are
      influenced by choreographed kung fu fights.[6] The dancers' ability to
      improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions
      between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and
      musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group
      Rock Steady Crew, described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung
      fu movie, "where the one kung fu master says something along the lines of
      'hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,' then a fight erupts."[6]

    <h2 id="Sambo">5.Sambo</h2>
    <p id="samboDesc">
      Sambo (Russian) is a martial art with Soviet origins, an internationally
      practised combat sport,and a recognized style of amateur wrestling
      included by UWW in the World Wrestling Championships along with
      Graeco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling.
      <br />
      It originated in the Russian SFSR in the Soviet Union. The word sambo is
      an acronym of samozashchita bez oruzhiya (Russian: самозащита без оружия),
      which literally translates to 'self-defence without weapons'.SAMBO is a
      martial art and combat sport developed and used by the Soviet Red Army in
      the early 1920s to improve their hand-to-hand combat abilities. The sport
      is similar in many ways to judo and jiu jitsu but also incorporates
      different types of wrestling and various self-defence systems. Soviet
      martial arts expert Vasili Oshchepkov is credited as one of the founding
      fathers of SAMBO. Born into a family of exiles in 1893, Oshchepkov also
      played a key role in introducing judo into the Soviet Union. An
      intelligence officer during both Tsarist and Soviet periods, he was
      educated in Japan and later returned there to work in the 1920s. He
      studied at the Kodokan Judo Institute in Tokyo, founded by Jigoro Kano,
      and eventually became the first Russian to receive a second dan in the
      sport. This led to him developing the SAMBO self-defence techniques which
      were developed and utilised by the Soviet Red Army and intelligence
      services.
      <br />
      Oshchepkov, despite his important legacy, ultimately died in prison aged
      just 45 as a result of the Stalinist political purges of 1937 after
      accusations of being a Japanese spy. He was posthumously "rehabilitated"
      and cleared of wrongdoing in 1957. Viktor Spiridonov and Anatoly
      Kharlampiev, a student of Oshchepkov, are also considered pioneers of
      SAMBO. Spiridonov and Oshchepkov independently developed two different
      styles, which eventually cross-pollinated and became what is known as
      SAMBO.
      <br />
      <b>Combat Sambo</b>
      <br />
      Combat sambo (Russian: Боевое Самбо, romanized: Boyevoye Sambo). Used and
      developed for the military, combat sambo resembles modern mixed martial
      arts, including forms of striking and grappling. Combat sambo allows
      regular punches, kicks, elbows, and knees, as well as soccer kicks,
      headbutts and groin strikes, in addition to throws, holds, chokes and
      locks, except for a standing or flying wristbar.The chief distinction from
      Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), apart from striking techniques, is that combat
      sambo rules and regulations do not permit a one-sided resort to ground
      fighting without throws or other combative manoeuvres (i.e., by simply
      sitting down and continuing from the ground without touching his opponent
      that BJJ allows). In terms of aliveness, combat sambo surpasses ARB by
      design, though both were designed for combat situations only. Competitors
      wear jackets as in sport sambo, but also hand protection and sometimes
      shin protection and headgear. The first FIAS World Combat Sambo
      Championships were held in 2001. The World Combat Sambo Federation, based
      in Russia, also sanctions international combat sambo events. Combat sambo
      is designed to tackle certain tasks. The effectiveness of this martial art
      determined by its structure, namely by three components: boxing, sambo,
      and adapters. Adapters of combat sambo were developed by the academician
      G. S. Popov. The task of adapters is to ensure the safe transition from
      middle distance to close one, as well as the consistent usage of sambo and
      boxing techniques. The given configuration provides the fusion of two
      martial arts into a single system.
      <br />
      <b>Freestyle Sambo</b>
      <br />
      This type of Sambo was introduced by the American Sambo Association in
      2004. Its purpose was to encourage non-Sambo practitioners such as Judo
      and Jiu-Jitsu to participate in Sambo. Freestyle Sambo allows the use of
      chokeholds and other submission techniques that are not used in Sambo
      wrestling.

    <h2 id="MCMAP">6.MCMAP- Marine Corps Martial Arts Program</h2>
    <img id="mcmapPic" src="./images/mcmap.png" />
    <p id="mcmapDesc">
      The Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) is a combat system developed
      by the United States Marine Corps to combine existing and new hand-to-hand
      and close quarters combat techniques with morale and team-building
      functions and instruction in the warrior ethos.The program, which began in
      2001, trains Marines (and U.S. Navy personnel attached to Marine units) in
      unarmed combat, edged weapons, weapons of opportunity, and rifle and
      bayonet techniques. It also stresses mental and character development,
      including the responsible use of force, leadership, and teamwork.
      <br />
      The MCMAP was officially created by Marine Corps Order 1500.54, published
      in 2002, as a "revolutionary step in the development of martial arts
      skills for Marines and replaces all other close-combat related systems
      preceding its introduction."MCMAP comes from an evolution dating back to
      the creation of the Marine Corps, beginning with the martial abilities of
      Marine boarding parties, who often had to rely on bayonet and cutlass
      techniques. During World War I these bayonet techniques were supplemented
      with unarmed combat techniques, which often proved useful in trench
      warfare. Between the world wars, Colonel Anthony J. Biddle began the
      creation of standardized bayonet and close combat techniques based on
      boxing, wrestling, savate and fencing. Also during this period, Captains
      Wallace M. Greene and Samuel B. Griffith learned Kung Fu techniques from
      Chinese American Marines and brought this knowledge to other Marines
      throughout the Marine Corps.
      <br />
      In 1956, at Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) San Diego, Lieutenant
      Colonel Ralph Hayward (captain of the Judo team at MCRD) made Gunnery
      Sergeant Bill Miller the new Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of
      hand-to-hand combat. Miller was ordered to develop a new curriculum that
      any Marine could use to quickly kill the enemy. Miller created the program
      from various martial arts such as Okinawan karate, judo, taekwondo,
      boxing, and jujutsu. Every Marine recruit that went through MCRD was
      instructed in Miller's combat curriculum. This also included special
      operations forces from all branches of the military and civilian entities.
      Later in 2001, retired Gunnery Sergeant Bill Miller was awarded the Black
      Belt Emeritus "for pioneering Martial Arts in the United States Marine
      Corps."
      <br />
      <b>Structure and belt system</b>
      <br />
      <b>1.Tan belt,</b> the lowest color belt and conducted during entry level
      training, signifies the basic understanding of the mental, physical, and
      character disciplines. It is the minimum requirement of all Marines with a
      training time of 27.5 hours and has no prerequisites. Recruits receive
      these belts after completion of a practical application test on all of the
      basic techniques of the Tan Belt.
      <br />
      <b>2.Gray belt</b> is the second belt attained after 25 hours of training.
      It signifies an intermediate understanding of the basic disciplines.
      <br />
      <b>3.Green belt</b> is the third belt, requiring 25 hours of training.
      This belt signifies understanding of the intermediate fundamentals of the
      different disciplines. This is the first belt level in which one can
